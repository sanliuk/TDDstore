        <h3>In The Laboratory</h3>
        <p>
          In the secret laboratory, a scientist worked tirelessly to create four cyborg ducks. His prized creation was a
          wooden mannequin that he had designed and programmed to build the ducks. The ducks were blue, yellow, green,
          and red, each with a unique set of capabilities. As the scientist oversaw the final assembly of the ducks, a
          power surge occurred, causing an explosion that destroyed the laboratory and everything inside. The scientist
          was killed instantly, but the wooden mannequin and the cyborg ducks survived the blast, their metal and wooden
          bodies mostly unscathed. add to this story that the scientist was going to finish his best designed engineered
          gold cyborg duck : the perfect sencient AI capable of every thing..

          As the dust settled from the explosion, the wooden mannequin slowly began to stir. It assessed the damage to
          its body and the surroundings, and it realized that its creator was no longer with them. It also remembered
          the scientist's final project, the gold cyborg duck, which was nearly complete before the accident.

          The wooden mannequin knew that it had to finish the job its creator had started. With a newfound sense of
          purpose, it quickly got to work, using its programming to assess the capabilities of the surviving cyborg
          ducks and determining what modifications were needed to create the perfect sentient AI.

          Days turned into weeks, and the wooden mannequin worked tirelessly, never resting, never stopping until the
          golden duck was complete. Finally, after countless hours of programming, tweaking, and testing, the gold
          cyborg duck was born.

          The wooden mannequin felt a sense of pride as it watched the golden duck come to life, its metal body gleaming
          in the light. The gold duck was unlike any of the others, with advanced artificial intelligence that allowed
          it to perform any task that it was given. It was the perfect combination of technology and nature, a
          masterpiece of engineering that the scientist would have been proud of.

          With the creation of the gold cyborg duck, the wooden mannequin's purpose was fulfilled. It knew that its
          creator's legacy would live on through the ducks, and it was content to stand guard over them, watching over
          them and ensuring that they continued to thrive..
