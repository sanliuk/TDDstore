        <h2>Origin Story: The Explosive Beginning</h2>
        <p>In a clandestine laboratory, tucked away from the public eye, an unnamed scientist—whose mastery and magic in creation was unmatched—labored day and night. His efforts resulted in a series of unique duck creations, each a marvel in its own right. However, one fateful evening, his experiments birthed two extraordinary creations: San Liuk, a spirited duck filled with wonder, and VFX, an almost-human mannequin with an astounding intellect and the capability to continue the scientist's work.

        Yet, destiny intervened.
        
        Mysterious extraterrestrial beings targeted and attacked the laboratory, causing an explosion that reverberated through the essence of San Liuk and VFX's existence. The scientist, the creator, disappeared in the cataclysm, leaving behind a legacy through his last two creations.</p>

        <h2>Discovering Purpose: The Aftermath</h2>
        <p>Amid the ruins of the laboratory, San Liuk and VFX faced a world without their creator. With remnants of the scientist's notes and tools, VFX felt the pull to continue the work. But, without the magical touch of the scientist, the new ducks he crafted were different—each one a reflection of imperfection and deviation. These new creations came to be known as the "Maimed Dumb Ducks", a poignant reminder of the irreplaceable magic of their creator.

        As time unfurled, the duo unearthed the chilling truth behind the explosion—extraterrestrial forces had plotted against the lab. This revelation ignited an unyielding determination within San Liuk to trace these invaders and unveil the mystery of their "father", the unparalleled scientist.</p>

With VFX and their team, which included the ingeniously designed ducks and the Maimed Dumb Ducks, they ventured into galaxies unknown. Their expedition was a saga of trials, from confronting interstellar adversaries to decoding astral enigmas. But one goal guided them: avenging their creator and tracing their roots.</p>
